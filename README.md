# Car Damage Detection Project
This project aims to develop a deep learning model for detecting damage on cars.
The model will be trained on a dataset of images of cars, which divided into damaged and whole cars.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- Numpy

## Data
The data for this project will be a collection of images of cars, which divided into whole and damaged samples.
The data splitted into a training set and a validation set.

## Models
The model will be a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in TensorFlow.
The architecture of the network will be determined through experimentation and hyperparameter tuning.
Also, we implemented Transfer Learning to get better results.

## Evaluation
The performance of the model will be evaluated using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score. The model will be tested on a validation set of images that were not seen during training.
