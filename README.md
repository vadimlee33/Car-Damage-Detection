# Car Damage Detection Project
This project aims to develop a deep learning model for detecting damage on cars.
The model will be trained on a dataset of images of cars, which divided into damaged and whole cars.
## Data
The data for this project will be a collection of images of cars, with annotations indicating the presence and location of damage. The data should be split into a training set and a validation set.

## Model
The model will be a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in TensorFlow. The architecture of the network will be determined through experimentation and hyperparameter tuning.

## Training
The model will be trained using the Adam optimization algorithm and binary cross-entropy loss. The training process will be monitored using accuracy and loss metrics, and the model will be saved after each epoch.

## Inference
Once the model is trained, it can be used for inference on new images of cars. The model will output a heatmap indicating the presence and location of damage.

## Evaluation
The performance of the model will be evaluated using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score. The model will be tested on a validation set of images that were not seen during training.
